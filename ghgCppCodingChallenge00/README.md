# GHG Coding Challenge

This is the repository for the GHG Coding Challenge. Please, read the exercise.txt to get the instruction for the coding task. We provide a CMakeLists.txt which you can use if you want to build the project using CMake - but feel free to use any build system you want. As soon as you completed the task please push your code in a separate branch which should be named according to the following scheme: <FirstnameLastname>-<Date>-<task> e.g. MaxMustermann-2016-01-01-read_file_and_sort

Make sure the program 

* fulfills the requirements,
* is flexible and 
* can be extended well.

In addition, we value

* readable and 'clean' code,
* tests and 
* reasonable handling of git.

You have 2 h maximum to solve the task and to push it to the repository.

Who do I talk to? In case of any questions please contact luis.ferrer@gotthardt.com or sven.peter@gotthardt.com
