Write a C++ program that does the following:

Use names.txt, a text file containing over 5000 first names, and sort it into alphabetical order.
Then work out the alphabetical value for each name and multiply this value by its position in the list to obtain a name score.

For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So COLIN would obtain a score of 938 x 53 = 49714.

What is the total sum of all the name scores in the file?
